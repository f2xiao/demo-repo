# Resources and References

After graduated and worked full-time for a while, I feel lost at the beginning when I tried to self-leaning programming. The reason is that because I am so eager to achieve something or just magically learn everything in a short time. But the truth is no, there's no shortcut and a strategy of learning is needed to avoid being overwhelmed by a lot of information and get frustrated. Thanks for this course that I find on Coursera that provides a lot of information about how to use your brain wisely, making leaning a breeze daily.
I would recommend everyone in a similar situation to start with this course first.

8. Facts and myths about Python names and values
    Assignment never copies data.
    Python is neither "Call By value" nor "Call By Reference", it's "Call by Assignment"!
    There is no way in python where a name can refer to another name. A name can only refer to values.
