# Practice for book of "Automate the boring stuff with Python"

This is where I begin my journey of self study of programming. I will share my code of the practice questions and projects here. Hope this will help people who need it on their journey! I will also share with the resources like tutorials, guidelines, websites that have been helpful to me.

1. The first guideline that I want to share is how to setup Git and Github. It is extremely important to start use this at the beginning to show your projects since it will be helpful for job search.
