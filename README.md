Thanks for this course that I find on Coursera that provides a lot of information about how to use your brain wisely, making leaning a breeze daily.

    Assignment never copies data.
    Python is neither "Call By value" nor "Call By Reference", it's "Call by Assignment"!
    There is no way in python where a name can refer to another name. A name can only refer to values:
